To run the program, refer to the main.cpp file. The program performs the following tasks: 
1) Reads a sequence of 32-bit integers from a file, where the first integer indicates the number of elements in the sequence. 
2) Encodes the sequence using the Reverse Multi-Delimiter codes, with smaller integers corresponding to shorter codewords. 
3) Calculates the average time it takes to retrieve a random element from the sequence. 

To run the program, provide one command line argument: the name of the file containing the integer sequence. 
You can find test data for this program at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BbyUif9FcJJaQWPIimLyvJVOSuMxRvE7/view?usp=sharing. 
The test data includes two files with integers generated from a 200MB English text from Pizza&Chilie corpus. The integers represent the indices of text symbols in the alphabet, sorted by descending frequencies.
