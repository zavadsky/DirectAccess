The program in the main.cpp file:
1) Reads the sequence of 32-bit integers from the file. The first integer is the number of elements in the sequence.
2) Encodes this sequence with the Reverse Multi-Delimiter codes. Smaller integers correspond to shorter codewords.
3) Calculates the average time of getting the random element of the sequence.

The program has 1 command line argument: the name of the file consisting of integer sequence.
